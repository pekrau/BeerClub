Hello {name},

From 1st Jan 2020, there are a couple of important changes in the
SciLifeLab Beer Club.


Short version: Take a beer, pay 25:- SEK by Swish. No other action needed.


Longer version:

1) The price for a beer has been increased to 25:- SEK. This is the
first raise since the Beer Club started ten years ago. The price for a
soft drink is unchanged at 10:- SEK.

2) The payment process has been simplified:

  - When you pay by Swish, you should *NOT* record the purchase in the
    Beer Club app.

  - When you pay by cash, you should *NOT* record the purchase in the
    Beer Club app.

  - The only time you need to record the purchase in the Beer Club app
    https://beerclub.scilifelab.se/ is when you want to use your credit.

Hopefully, this should simplify things for everyone.


Questions? Ask me.

Yours,

Per Kraulis

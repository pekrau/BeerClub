Hello {name},

Reminder: From 1st Jan 2020, there are a couple of important changes
in the SciLifeLab Beer Club.


Short version: Take a beer and pay 25:- SEK by Swish. Do not record anything
in the Beer Club app.


Longer version:

1) The price for a beer has been increased to 25:- SEK. This is the
first raise since the Beer Club started ten years ago. The price for a
soft drink is unchanged at 10:- SEK.

2) The payment process has been simplified:

  - When you pay by Swish, you should *NOT* record the purchase in the
    Beer Club app. This is the recommended way of paying.

  - When you pay by cash, you should *NOT* record the purchase in the
    Beer Club app. Please avoid cash. It is cumbersome to handle.

  - The only time you need to record the purchase in the Beer Club app
    https://beerclub.scilifelab.se/ is when you want to use your credit,
    i.e. increase your debt. This should be used only if you will pay your
    debt ASAP by bank transfer.

Hopefully, this should simplify things for everyone.
